# Movie list app readme

To get the project running:
- enter your api key for The Movie Database API into the index.html file,
- run the app by opening the index.html file within your web browser,
- tested in Google Chrome,
- it's been assumed that the base URL for thumbnails won't change, however to be on the safe side you could poll the configuration endpoint for any updates and cache the new base URL locally,
- currently missing pagination and tests.
